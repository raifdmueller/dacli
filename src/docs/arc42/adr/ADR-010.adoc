=== ADR-010: No Web UI — dacli is CLI and MCP Only

*Status:* Accepted (2026-02-07)

*Context:*
The original architecture documents (Quality Requirements, Concepts) assumed a Web UI component for dacli — specifically a document structure visualization (#12) and a real-time diff display (#13). Quality scenario USAB-3 described a "web UI" showing red/green diffs after modifications.

However, dacli has evolved into a pure **CLI tool and MCP server** designed for LLM integration. The primary consumers are:

* LLMs using dacli via MCP (Model Context Protocol)
* LLMs using dacli via CLI/Bash tools
* Developers using the CLI directly

A Web UI would be a fundamentally different product — it requires frontend development (HTML/CSS/JS), serving static files, browser compatibility, and ongoing maintenance. This is outside dacli's core mission of providing structured, programmatic access to documentation.

Tools like docToolchain already provide web-based documentation rendering. Adding a Web UI to dacli would duplicate that effort without clear benefit.

*Decision:*
dacli will **not include a Web UI**. The project scope is limited to CLI and MCP server interfaces. References to a Web UI in existing architecture documents will be removed.

*Consequences:*

_Positive:_

* Clear, focused scope — CLI and MCP only
* No frontend dependencies or maintenance burden
* Simpler deployment (no static file serving, no browser compatibility)
* Architecture documents accurately reflect the actual system

_Negative:_

* No visual diff display for documentation changes (LLMs and developers use the API/CLI output instead)
* No interactive tree visualization (LLMs use `get_structure` programmatically)
