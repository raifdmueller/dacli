"""Tests for Issue #160: Detect unresolved includes in validate command.

Ensures the validate command (MCP tool, CLI, and service layer) correctly
detects and reports missing include files as 'unresolved_include' errors.

The implementation was done in Issue #219. This test file adds MCP-level
coverage and closes Issue #160 which originally requested this feature.
